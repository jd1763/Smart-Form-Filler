  Smart Form Filler | Python, JS, Flask, scikit-learn, SBERT, Chrome MV3, Docker, AWS              GitHub | Demo: <links> 

•  Designed and built a Chrome MV3 extension that scans job applications, detects 60+ field types, applies 

confidence scoring, handles checkbox/radio logic, and autofills forms to significantly reduce manual form filling. 

•  Trained an NLP label classifier in Python (scikit-learn: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and a resume-to-job 

description matcher (Sentence-BERT) to score fit and surface matched and missing skills.  

•  Built multiple web-facing features including REST API integrations, client-side workflows, and full-stack logic 

across Flask + JavaScript, similar to modern full-stack environments (React + Node/Python). 

•  Dockerized the Flask backend and deployed it to AWS Cloud Run, adding S3-backed resume storage and a simple 

docker-compose flow so contributors can run the API locally or in Docker with one command. 

•  Designed a lightweight ETL system to parse resumes, extract structured data, and store text/profile assets across 

AWS S3 and local storage for cross-environment support. 

  Online Railway Booking System | Java, SQL, JSP, HTML, CSS                                 

                GitHub | Demo: <links> 

•  Co-developed a full-featured railway booking system with real-time schedule and reservation management using 

JSP, HTML, and CSS, enabling a dynamic and user-friendly web interface. 

•  Developed full-stack JSP/HTML/CSS pages with SQL-backed dynamic content, comparable to CMS and template-

driven web environments used in agencies. 

•  Used JDBC and MySQL to design and optimize secure, efficient queries that reduced redundant data operations, 

accelerated page load times, and improved overall system responsiveness. 

•  Deployed using Eclipse and Tomcat Server, optimizing backend performance and data retrieval. 

  Pizza Ordering App | Java, Android SDK, JUnit                                                                             GitHub | Demo: <links> 
•  Developed an Android app for pizza ordering using Java and Android SDK, applying OOP principles such as 

inheritance and polymorphism to reduce repetitive logic and improve long-term code flexibility. 
Implemented Singleton pattern for managing orders and added JUnit tests to catch edge-case bugs early. 

• 
•  Adopted an MVC-style structure to separate UI and logic, improving code clarity and maintainability. 
• 

Integrated RecyclerView, Toast, and AlertDialog to build an interactive ordering workflow, providing customers 
with real-time feedback and a polished UI; stabilized the app with extensive functional testing in Android Studio.
