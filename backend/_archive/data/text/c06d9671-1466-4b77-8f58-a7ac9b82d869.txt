  Smart Form Filler | Python, JS, Flask, scikit-learn, SBERT, Chrome MV3, Docker, AWS         GitHub | Demo: <links>   
•  Designed and built a Chrome MV3 extension that scans job apps, detects 60+ field types, applies confidence 

scoring, handles checkbox/radio logic re-scans after Add Education/Experience, and autofills to speed submissions. 

•  Trained an NLP label classifier in Python (scikit-learn: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and a resume-to-job 

description matcher (Sentence-BERT) to score fit and surface matched and missing skills.  

•  Shipped Edit My Answers and Manage Resume so users can customize answers/files and upload/view/delete 

resumes; store resume PDFs in SQLite (db.sqlite) and persist users’ answers/preferences in JSON. 

•  Dockerized the Flask backend and deployed it to AWS Cloud Run with S3 for resume storage, enabling scalable 

cloud integration and simplified setup with docker compose up. 

•  Connected the extension to a Flask REST API with content-script to background messaging, added 40+ pytest tests 

and GitHub Actions CI, and hardened for CSP/permissions stability. 

  Online Railway Booking System | Java, SQL, JSP, HTML, CSS                                 

             GitHub | Demo: <links> 
•  Co-developed a full-featured railway booking system with real-time schedule and reservation management using 

JSP, HTML, and CSS, enabling a dynamic and user-friendly web interface. 

•  Structured the system with a three-tier architecture to isolate logic and simplify future maintenance. 
•  Used JDBC and MySQL to design and optimize secure, efficient queries that reduced redundant data operations, 

accelerated page load times, and improved overall system responsiveness. 

•  Deployed using Eclipse and Tomcat Server, optimizing backend performance and data retrieval. 

  RU Pizzeria Android App | Java, Android SDK, JUnit                                                                GitHub | Demo: <links> 
•  Developed an Android app for pizza ordering using Java and Android SDK, applying OOP principles such as 

inheritance and polymorphism to reduce repetitive logic and improve long-term code flexibility. 
Implemented Singleton pattern for managing orders and added JUnit tests to catch edge-case bugs early. 

• 
•  Adopted an MVC-style structure to separate UI and logic, improving code clarity and maintainability. 
• 

Integrated RecyclerView, Toast, and AlertDialog to build an interactive ordering workflow, providing customers 
with real-time feedback and a polished UI; stabilized the app with extensive functional testing in Android Studio.
